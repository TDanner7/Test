## Career Goals
My goal is to support start ups by being a jack of all trades. By knowing both corporate finance as well as coding I think I can be a vital part of a team.
## Why FinTech
FinTech seems to be the obvious next step in my career, having been in finance for the past half decade I have seen how important technology has become. It will only become more impotant in the future. Furthermore, the idea of combining such an established industry with new innovation is something that I dont want to watch from the outside.
